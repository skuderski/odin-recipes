This is my first project ever that I'm doing from The Odin Project. At the beginning this project was html only but then I added css. It is about three of my favorite dishes.
It lists all the ingredients as well as what steps to take to cook them.

Main takeaways from doing this project:
1.practiced html boilerplate from my head,
2.learned what type of links there are and how to link things together(relative and absolute),
3.learned how to embed an image into the page using a src attribute,
4.learned how to use headings, unordered and ordered lists properly so it looks good on a page,
5.learned css foundations from exercises on the odin project which I could apply here,
6.learned how to link html to css,
7.learned how to use class selectors well and link them
